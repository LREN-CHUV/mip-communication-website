        <p>
          Through the newly established CREACTIVE project, the PROSAFE consortium focuses attention
          on TBI, on which data collection started in March 2014. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is
          among the leading causes of death and disability and the main cause of death among the
          under-45s.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aims of the project are to consolidate the existing network in order to better
          describe the epidemiology of moderate-severe TBI in 7 countries (Greece and Israel have
          now joined the consortium); build a prognostic model based on short- and long-term outcome
          measures; identify the most effective clinical interventions for optimally treating TBI
          patients, and recognize the determinants of optimal vs suboptimal performance.
